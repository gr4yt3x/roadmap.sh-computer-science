A tree is a data structure that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes. 

Each node of a tree has a parent node, except for the root node, and zero or more child nodes.
A tree data structure can be used to represent hierarchical relationships, such as a file system where the directories are the parent nodes and the files are the child nodes. 

The tree structure allows for efficient insertion, deletion and search operations. The tree is divided into levels, with the root node being at level 0, and each child node being at a level one greater than its parent. The height of a tree is the number of levels in the longest path from the root to a leaf node.

The most common types of tree data structures are binary trees, where each node has at most two children, and balanced trees, such as AVL trees and Red-black trees, which are more complex but provide more efficient search operations. These trees maintain a certain balance property to avoid degeneration of the tree to a linked list, which can occur in unbalanced trees.
