# Stack



The stack data structure is a linear data structure that accompanies a principle known as  LIFO (Last In First Out) or FILO (First In Last Out). Real-life examples of a stack are a deck of cards, piles of books, piles of money, and many more.

<i>INSERT </i> - PUSH( )<br>
<i>DELETE </i> - POP( )<br>
<i>RETRIEVE </i> - PEEK( )

Inserting a new element in the stack is termed a push operation.
Removing or deleting elements from the stack is termed pop operation
