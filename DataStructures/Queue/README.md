# Queue 
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. 

Operations typically performed on a queue include enqueue (adding an element to the back of the queue) and dequeue (removing the element from the front of the queue). 
Queues are often used in computer science for tasks such as scheduling and managing processes.
